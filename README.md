# Workshops (ws)
These are weekly assignments that prove a student's understanding of the material taught that week. The **in-labs** are workshops that are done in class with the professor but can be done ahead of time by student on their own. The **at-home** workshops are a continuation of the in-labs but with an added level of difficulty and is, as would be expected, to be done "at home" or without guidance.


# Milestones (ms)
The milestones are a breakdown of a project. These are assigned within the last couple of weeks of the term.


# Other things to note
* Depending on the workshop or milestone, header and implementation files may have already been provided by the professor. Oftentimes it is the header and main files that's given. **To see if it has been provided, check PDF instructions or what files are available for the given lab under the *IPC-Project-master* folder.**

* All work for this course is submitted via PuTTy. The files are transferred on WinSCP then ran on the terminal. All code must match the exact output as seen in the instructions. That means every line, character, space, newline, input is identical to the output of the professor's code.
