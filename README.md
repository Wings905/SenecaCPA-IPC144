# Workshops (ws)
* Weekly assignments 
* **in-labs** are workshops done in class with the professor 
* **at-home** workshops are a continuation of in-labs but with added level of difficulty


# Milestones (ms)
* The milestones are a breakdown of a project 
* Assigned within the last couple of weeks of the term
* More difficult than workshops


# Other things to note
* Depending on the workshop or milestone, header and implementation files may have already been provided by the professor. Oftentimes it is the header and main files that's given. **To see if it has been provided, check PDF instructions or what files are available for the given lab under the *IPC-Project-master* folder.**

* All work for this course is done on Visual Studio and submitted via PuTTy. The files are transferred on WinSCP then ran on the terminal. All code must match the exact output as seen in the instructions.

* The workshops follow the format of the following outlined text: https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~ipc144/pages/timeline.html
